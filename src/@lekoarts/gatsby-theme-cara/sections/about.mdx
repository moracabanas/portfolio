## About

> I studied piano and I love music. I am a big fan of 3D printing, CAD design, programming, web developement, playing videogames and learning electronics.

My brother was a big influence on my carreer, he inspired me by bringing on his old school linux laptops every day allowing me to play with them when I was very young. 
I like to learn the skills I need on demand by making side projects on a regular basis. Learning to code is a hard thing with too many sintax to remeber but 
when you mix all that you learn and build something there is a very nice feeling about it I'm addicted to.
Most people complain about the fact you need to be constantly forced to learn new stuff by the fast changes in tech.
But I'm in fact amazed by those changes as I really apreciate there is new tools to build new projects every day and you don't have to be stuck for years on the same task if you don't want to.
